http://vmware.github.io/pyvmomi-community-samples/This is a place for anyone to learn about working with the vSphere Management SDK's native python binding library pyVmomi. Samples here are contributed by developers like you and curated by your fellow developers. The quality and validity of the samples will vary, however, if you see a problem report it! If you can solve someone's problem, contribute a fix! If you need a new sample ask for one!

Getting Started
First, you'll need a functioning Python environment. This may differ by operating system and distribution.

get Python
get pip (Note: see the package manager section)
get pyvmomi using pip
 $ pip install pyvmomi
Now you are ready to get and use the samples project:

 $ git clone https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi-community-samples.git
If you can't use git for some reason, you can download the tar or zip file instead.
